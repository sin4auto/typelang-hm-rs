Sequential Thinking MCP Server\n\nAn MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process.\n\n## Features\n\n- Break down complex problems into manageable steps\n- Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens\n- Branch into alternative paths of reasoning\n- Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically\n- Generate and verify solution hypotheses\n\n## Tool\n\n### sequential_thinking\n\nFacilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis.\n\n**Inputs:**\n- `thought` (string): The current thinking step\n- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed\n- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number\n- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed\n- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous thinking\n- `revisesThought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being reconsidered\n- `branchFromThought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought number\n- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier\n- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are needed\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Sequential Thinking tool is designed for:\n- Breaking down complex problems into steps\n- Planning and design with room for revision\n- Analysis that might need course correction\n- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Usage with Claude Desktop\n\nAdd this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:\n\n#### npx\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sequential-thinking\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### docker\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"sequentialthinking\": {\n      \"command\": \"docker\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"run\",\n        \"--rm\",\n        \"-i\",\n        \"mcp/sequentialthinking\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo disable logging of thought information set env var: `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING` to `true`.\nComment\n\n### Usage with VS Code\n\nFor quick installation, click one of the installation

manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`.\n\nOptionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.\n\n> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.\n\nFor NPX installation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"sequential-thinking\": {\n        \"command\": \"npx\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"-y\",\n          \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor Docker installation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcp\": {\n    \"servers\": {\n      \"sequential-thinking\": {\n        \"command\": \"docker\",\n        \"args\": [\n          \"run\",\n          \"--rm\",\n          \"-i\",\n          \"mcp/sequentialthinking\"\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Building\n\nDocker:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t mcp/sequentialthinking -f src/sequentialthinking/Dockerfile .\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis MCP server is licensed under the MIT License.
